## IDE

Our recommended IDE for documentation purposes is RStudio.  You must install R, RStudio at least to make it work.  For PDF outputs, you need to add a pdf compiler (recommended: tinytex, a lightweight tex compiler.) If you want to run Python code within RStudio, you need to have Pyhton installed on your computer, too.
