# Welcome {-}

`I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.` â€” *Mark Twain* 

For collaborators who do not write code, the general [Introduction](#intro) contains  a [Simple Introduction](#simple-intro) focusing on documentation tools only. Contributors with no coding experience and ambition will likely work with [data curation](#data-curation) and [documentation,  publications](#documentation) which is equally important to developing code. You must be familiar with our developers [naming conventions](#naming-conventions), because we automate research: their programs create data tables, visualizations, maps, blogposts, even books following this vocabulary.

Most of this long-form documentation is intended for collaborators who write code to [acquire data](#acquisition), [store data](#data-storage), create applications such a [statistics](#statistical-software), or [machine learning applications](#machine-learning), and who help us [publish data](#data-release).

Open collaboration is an agile project management method that breaks up the tasks to small, independent, decentralized acts that can be performed by individuals or research groups.  It requires a solid shared knowledge base and a very high quality documentation. This collaboration guide serves two goals: to practice this documentation workflow, and to create a continuously improved documentation for our collaboration methods and practices.
