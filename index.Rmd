# Welcome

We work with data in the R and Python language, and we are open for C++, too. Our documentation is made in markdown to be able to produce html, pdf, word, powerpoint, reveal.js or any type of output. Our long-form documentation is knit together with the help of the 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown' packages in the R language -- they combine YAML headers and enriched markdown that can contain R, Python or C++ executable code 'chunks', and our website use markdown, hugo, and the 'blogdown' connector between Go, R, and markdown.

This heterogeneous workflow is best served in RStudio.  While you can write code in your favorite IDE in Python and/or C++, RStudio is unrivaled in its capability to connect various markup languages and several programming languages. Therefore, for documentation purposes, we use RStudio.  You can contribute in any other editor -- our longform documentation and our website content is, after all, marked-up text.  If you need to execute something for within the documentation, only RStudio will do the trick.

Open collaboration is an agile project management method that breaks up the tasks to small, independent, decentralized acts that can be performed by individuals or research groups.  It requires a solid shared knowledge base and a very high quality documentation. This collaboration guide serves two goals: to practice this documentation workflow, and to create a continuously improved documentation for our collaboration methods and practices.

Provided that you use whatever IDE and Git/Github, there is unlikely that this guide will pose any challenge for you.  Markdown and YAML are very simple, special-purpose markdown “languages” (the language is a big word here) that you can learn in 1-2 hours. They create marked up text, which we use for a hypertextual reference guide.  To collaboration on our data products, there are other skills necessary, but for documentation, technically you can get started with a clean text editor and git.


```{r crate-bibliography, include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'regions', 'retroharmonize', 'iotables'), 'packages.bib')
```
