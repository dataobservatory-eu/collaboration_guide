# Data Acquistion {#acquisition}

Whatever is the source of the data we use it, we never trust it fully. We need check its strength and weaknesses, and bring it to a complete, documented and tidy form.

## Metadata {#collect-metadata}

Metadata plays an important role to find whatever we acquired and use it properly. It plays an important role during the storage of data in our [databases](#data-storage) and in [documentation and publication](#documentation), too.  We placed it into a [separate chapter](#metadata).
